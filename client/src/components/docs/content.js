        The cheapest premium-tier service gives you access to volumetric data
        for all tweets made within 30 days of the API request. It cost me around
        Â£120 to use it 30 days, and it is for this reason that this web app:{" "}

          <li>Is not using more recent data</li>
          <li>
            Does not have a search option, where a user can type in their own
            keyword(s) and get the findings displayed on charts.

        . Unlike a simple horizontal navbar, was tricky to get everything
        behaving correctly with this vertical sidebar. And when the sidebar was
        set up correctly, the rest of the page started behaving weirdly. It
        seems to be working fine now, but I'm sure I've made some mistakes with
        the CSS. I have tried to find them, but to no avail. That being said, I
        am sure this is something which I will get better at doing over time.

        <span className="first-line">Initially getting the data.</span> When I
        was learning about APIs I decided to throw myself into the deep-end by
        using the Twitter API, knowing that if I was unsuccessfull, I would have
        wasted the money I used to pay for the data with. While I did manage to
        get the data, it took me two whole weeks of searching on google,
        stackoverflow, and experimenting until I understood things like headers,
        bearer tokens, and manipulating the data received. I didn't want to use
        one of those helper packages (where you just type in your credentials
        and the search criteria) because I wanted to do it myself. I learned a
        lot during this period and I am quite confident with APIs now.

          Getting the same amount of data for each location.{" "}
        </span>
        Seeing as the study was done geographically, the locations aren't all
        the same size and so more data will come from some places than for
        others. London, for example, is much larger than Birmingham, so there
        were always more tweets coming from there. The same can be said for the
        USA compares to the UK. Because of this, the changes in activity was
        more important than the amount of activity.
      </div>,
      <div className="list-item">
        <span className="first-line">Getting reliable data.</span> Twitter
        didn't give reliable data when the tweet counts were very low. If an
        interval has no tweets with the specified keyword(s), it would show 0,
        but if there were anything between 1-5 tweets, it would always show 5.
        This made things unreliable when working with small amounts of data.
        This was the case, for example, with some intervals in the A-Level
        Results charts.
      </div>,
      <div className="list-item">
        <span className="first-line">Getting enough data.</span> A lot of
        searches didn't give enough results to let us make meaningful
        conclusions, and a big cause for this is the fact that most people
        nowadays have geolocation turned off for privacy concerns. If the study
        didn't require comparing between locations, it wouldn't be a problem,
        but in this case it meant less results.
