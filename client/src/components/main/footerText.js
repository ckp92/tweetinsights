    "It's hard to tell, but if you hover over the actual points, there are spikes in the number of tweets recorded inthe UK, in accordance with major trends regarding the late, infamous Jeffery Epstein! The huge volume of tweets coming from the USA make it difficult to plot the UK on the same chart.",
    "On a similar note, the US data HAS been plotted on the graph, just it is so close to the global data, that it seems like it doesn't exist. Rest assured, if you hover over the points, you will see two sets of results - one for the USA and the other for global results.",
    "That being said, the reliability of the data does come into question here because many of the global results are the exact same as the counts for the USA."

    "On the chart for the entire month, we can see spikes in tweet volume during the periods when the Ashes cricket matches were being played.",
    "A huge spike can be seen on the 25th of August, which represents Ben Stokes carrying England to a sensational win. This can be seen in more detail during in the 'Ashes: Third Test', where we can see the massive spike at around 3pm, which is around the time England won.",
    "As expected, there were a lot ot tweet mentions during the first test, mainly because of the hype as the series commenced.",
    "The volume of tweets can be seen to vary according to where the tests were played. The first test was played in Edgbaston and a lot of tweets came from Birmingham during that period. The same trend can be seen for tweets coming from London during the second test, as it was played at Lord's. The fourth test was played in Manchester at the Old Trafford Cricket Ground, but unfortunately the data for that period wasn't available when I was conducting this study. That being said, I have a feeling it would show similar results!"

    "I thought it would be interesting to see trends around the time Boris Johnson became the leader of the Conservative party (and the new PM). This happened on the 23rd of July and as the results show, there was a large spike in tweets on that day.",
    "The trends for the Conservative party show a lot of similarity across the three cities, but not as much for the Labour party.",
    "Overall the volume of tweets corresponds to the size of the cities, with the most coming from London and the least from Birmingham."

  alevelresults2019: [
    "The goal here was to compare the four quadrants of London and see which universities were being mentioned in tweets on the A-Level results day (15th August).",
    "The top 40 universities in the country were chosen and grouped together into 4 deciles, in rank-order (so the top 10 in the first group, 11-20 in the second, etc).",
    "Then each quadrant was tested to see how many university mentions it got from each decile. This would give a rough idea of how the quality of education differs accross London. Unfortunately the results were not very reliable.",
    "The overall number of tweets was a lot lower than I expected and it seems like this is where the problem lies. The interval used to collect the data was on an hourly basis. If there were no tweets (mentioning a university) in a certain decile, the count would be 0. The next highest number of tweets I would see would be 5. There was never 1, 2, 3, or 4. This leads me to believe if there were between 1-5 tweets, it would always show up as 5. If you hover over the points, you can see this for yourself.",
    "The overall low volume of results meant that this was the case in a lot of the hourly intervals, which affected the reliability of the data."
